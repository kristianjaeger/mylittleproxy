This is an example of an Apigee proxy with some basic policies in place also (response caching, spike arrest, JSON &amp; XML threat protection).

For full instructions on how to get the nodejs facade and proxy into Apigee please see - https://github.com/apigee/apigee-partner-se-bootcamp/tree/master/labs/API%20Services%20Lesson%206%20-%20Create%20a%20Node.js%20Proxy (This repo was obviously influenced heavily by that).

For more about Apigee policies please see - https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/reference-overview-policy . Cheers.

P.S. I'm still learning Apigee so please let me know if something could be improved (within the context of this simple example).  Cheers.
